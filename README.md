## Introduction
HealthCare Insights, a prominent healthcare research and analytics organization, is committed to enhancing comprehension of disease patterns, patient outcomes, and healthcare efficacy. Our team, comprising healthcare experts and skilled data analysts, is dedicated to delivering data-driven insights that enhance patient care and aid medical research. This EDA project perfectly aligns with our mission to harness data for informed healthcare decision-making.

## Problem Statement
**Healthcare Insights** recognizes the need for a comprehensive analysis of disease symptoms, patients demographics and disease outcomes. The problem at hand includes 

- Lack of sytematic exploration of dataset
- Absense of insihts that could help medical professionals
- Opportunity to identify patterns and trends

## Skills & Concepts Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Data Visualization
- Dashboard Development

## Modelling
I used Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the patterns and factors influencing diseases among patients. These approach involves summarizing and discovering insights from data without making any assumptions.

## Visualization

Interactive visualizations were created Using **Tableau** These visualization helps to show the distribution, frequency correlation and trends of different variables such as age, gender, disease outcome, cholesterol and blood pressure.

## Analysis

Using descriptive Analysis, comparative analysis which is simply comparing and contrasting different groups and catergories like negative and positive outcomes, different age groups, male or female to identify similarities and differences. i also used correlational analysis which is measuring and testing the strength and direction of the relationship between two or more variables such as cholesterol and blood pressure, asthma and hypertension to determine if there is any association or causation.

The analysis showed the following insights:

### Age-Based Analysis:
- Ages 19-30: 50 diseases, 54% positive outcomes.
- Ages 31-50: 189 diseases, 51% positive outcomes.
- Ages 51-70: 104 diseases, 54% positive outcomes.
- Ages 71-90: 6 diseases, all positive outcomes.

### Age-Specific Trends:
Peaks at 35 and 45 years with 42 cases each, and at 30 years with 28 cases, indicating potential risk factors.

### Risk Factors in Middle Age: 
Investigating the lifestyle habits, diet, exercise routines, and environmental factors of patients at peak ages **(35 and 45)** can unveil triggers for diseases, aiding prevention strategies.

## Further Insights for better Healthcare and research approach:

#### Disease Distribution: 
Among 349 patients, asthma affected 6.5%, stroke 4.5%, osteoporosis 4%, while migraine, diabetes, and hypertension each affected 2.8%.

#### Cholesterol & Blood Pressure: 
Patients with stroke tend to have both high cholesterol and high blood pressure, indicating a possible correlation between these factors and stroke risk.

#### Asthma & Blood Pressure: 
Asthma patients commonly experience high blood pressure, suggesting a potential link between respiratory conditions and hypertension.

## F A C T O R S - I N F L U E N C I N G - D I S E A S E S
#### Age as a Factor: 
Notably, patients in the 71-90 age group showed 100% positive outcomes. Understanding the factors contributing to these positive outcomes can provide valuable insights for future treatments.

#### Cholesterol & Blood Pressure: 
Patients with both high cholesterol and high blood pressure are prone to stroke, emphasizing the importance of managing these factors for prevention.

#### Asthma & Hypertension: 
Asthma patients with high blood pressure may face exacerbated health risks. Exploring this correlation can guide tailored treatments.
